              Hello, I'm Lukas Licon, a passionate gameplay programmer and software engineer with an interest in C++ and Game AI. My fascination with technology and video games began at a young age, fueled by countless hours immersed in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft. This early passion evolved into a career ambition to create immersive and engaging game experiences that captivate players as I was once captivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, providing me with a robust foundation in programming and game development. Each project has been a pivotal step in honing my technical skills and nurturing my creative vision. Through my studies, I've developed a strong affinity for challenges; the more complex the task, the more it captivates me. I thrive on pushing my limits, which is why, after spending a couple of years developing games in Unity at UCSC, I'm now enthusiastically jumping back into Unreal Engine. For the past three months, I've dedicated myself to working with Unreal Engine daily, eager to explore its potential and use my knowledge within C++ making an ARPG/Souls-like game as an indie developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond my technical expertise, I find deep satisfaction in translating a designer's vision into engaging gameplay that resonates with users. My work is driven by the belief that the best games are those that seamlessly blend creative concepts with precise execution, creating experiences that are both captivating and fun. Collaborating with cross-functional teams has taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork in bringing these visions to life. I am committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and continuously refining my skills, as I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in game development. My goal is to craft experiences that not only entertain but also leave a lasting impact on players, ensuring that every project I work on contributes to the joy and engagement of its audience while I continue to grow and learn as a developer.

              <p>
                This project, developed for CMPM 146, is a procedural city generator utilizing Unity and C#. The generator creates dynamic city layouts, leveraging the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to produce varied and coherent cityscapes with roads, buildings, and blocks that follow logical patterns while maintaining randomness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PCG-City-Generator employs procedural generation techniques to generate cityscapes with randomized road networks, building placements, and city blocks. The project highlights advanced procedural content generation concepts using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm to ensure cities are varied yet cohesive.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was developed to help game developers rapidly prototype mechanics in a random city environment based on their design constraints.

              <h4>Contributions</h4>
              <p>
                I helped create the `WaveFunctionCollapse.cs` file, which propagates constraints across the city grid, selecting valid tiles based on their compatibility with adjacent tiles and then collapsing the cell at the given position.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also hooked up neighboring assets to properly align with our specific design constraints.

The program is designed to exploit the expected sparseness of matrix operands, making it more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational performance. The main functionality is built around a custom implementation of a List Abstract Data Type (ADT), which is used to manipulate matrix data and perform shuffling operations. The project includes both the implementation and testing of the List ADT, along with the core program that performs the matrix operations.

            The Fractal Tiled Renderer generates a fractal image by dividing the image into tiles. Each tile is rendered asynchronously in parallel. Initially, `std::async` was used to manage parallel rendering of fractal tiles. However, this version refactors the program to utilize a thread-safe message queue with a fixed number of worker threads (e.g., 8 threads) for rendering the tiles. This project demonstrates concepts such as multithreading, thread-safe queues, and task distribution in C++.
